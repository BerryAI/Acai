# Music Recommendation by BerryAI
This project is a music recommendation system developed by BerryAI.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes
on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites Software
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
Python
Python-NumPy
```
#### Linux
All major distributions of Linux provide packages for both Python and NumPy.
#### Mac OS X
```
pip install numpy
```
#### Windows
Personally, I will recommend Anaconda as default Python compiler. To install
them, go to page
```
https://www.continuum.io/downloads
```
and find the proper install packages

### Prerequisites Dataset
In this project, we use some public open database, and they are

* Last.fm 1k user data [download](http://mtg.upf.edu/static/datasets/last.fm/lastfm-dataset-1K.tar.gz)
* Million Song Database[download](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/unique_tracks.txt)
* Million Song Database subset [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7s9m90eW6dtMnk5Q2M1aFBfeDA/view?usp=sharing)
* Echo Nest user data [download](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/challenge/train_triplets.txt.zip)

For convenience purpose, I have calculate the intersection between 1k user data
and MSD Database. [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7s9m90eW6dtX084eTNXQ2NLblU)
is the download link.

### Installation


## Usage
Test functions are under ./test folder. After downloading all the data files,
please put the extracted files into ./data folder.

Then run
```
python test_cf_hf_gd.py
```
in command line under the directory of the project installed.

### Collaborative Filtering Methods

#### * Memory based recommendation

The recommendation equation is: <br />
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/d/c1da0ee720e382372582a51ac2368925.png)

Where U is the full set of all users, ![](http://mathurl.com/hm6fwsr.png) is
 user u's rating score of item
i, and ![](http://mathurl.com/h7lc86c.png) is the average rating score for user
u. For similarity function ![](http://mathurl.com/gvgors5.png), we have two
approaching ways:

1. K nearest neighbours: <br />
![](http://mathurl.com/zgm3zlh.png)
Where ![](http://mathurl.com/jua8fgh.png) is the set of neighbors of user a.
2. Pearson Correlation: <br />

#### * Matrix Factorization and Hidden Features
We could use much smaller dimension matrix P, Q to represent and approximate the
full rating score matrix R. That is: <br />
![](http://mathurl.com/jy3us2x.png)

Normally, we have two different approaches:

1. Singular Value Decomposition

R is a m*n matrix
![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3315de0d8549ccefd4c619e4e6cce6ba041dde3c)

Where:
* M is m*m unitary matrix
* Î£ is m*n diagonal matrix with singular values
* N is n*n unitary matrix

With first k singular values, we could approximate R as: <br />

Then: <br />

2. Gradient Descent
We try to minimize the norm of residue matrix: <br />
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmin_%7BP%2CQ%7D%20F%28P%2CQ%29%20%3D%20%5C%7CR%20-%20PQ%5ET%5C%7C_2)

we have two different approaches:
* Classic Gradient Descent: <br />
![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0154a26cc6ac60465f8eb3d00d2f2dfa6899da2a)

* Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum: <br />
![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/350886f1e3aaa6e9352caca8581274df95ac54e6)

Both methods will converge, but please be careful choosing coefficients.
