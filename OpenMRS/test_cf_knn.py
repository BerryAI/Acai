    ~~~
    This module contains testing function of CF-KNN method

    In this tesing file, we generate rating matrix for 1k user playing history
    of songs in Million Song Dataset. Because there are large amount of miss
    match in two data source, we then calculate k nearest neighbours purely from
    1k user dataset. Then give the prediction for test user.
