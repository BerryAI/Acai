    test_cf_hf_gd.py
    ~~~
    This module contains testing function of SVD method to discover hidden
    features in collaborative filtering method

    In this tesing file, we generate rating matrix for 1k user playing history
    of songs in Million Song Dataset. Because there are large amount of miss
    match in two data source, we only generate rate matrix of tracks in MSD
    which are played by 1k user dataset. Then we user Gradient Descent method
    to discover the hidden features in the CF methods.
