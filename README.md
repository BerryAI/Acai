Project Acai is started by Berry Labs,which uses machine learning algorithms to solve daily issues. Acai(codename) is trying to solve the problem of "The Tyranny of Choice"(or "Paradox of Choice) to describe the misery of users facing over-abundant choices. In music area, especially in the age of streaming music service, this paradox becomes so significant to affect every single piece of choice when users trying to enjoy music. It's why this project is created.
